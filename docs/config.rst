The Config File
===============

This is where the magic happens. Here is a sample file which I will walk you through
so that you will be able to create your own awfterwards. ::

    questions:
      -   text: q1
          coding:
              -   criteria: Criteria1
              -   criteria: Criteria2
      -   text: q2
          coding:
              -   criteria: Was this shit useful?
              -   criteria: How can ths shit be useful?
    show:
        - item_id

Now back to the good part
